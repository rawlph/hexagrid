After thorough analysis of the turn system implementation, I've identified several issues and implemented fixes to make the turn management more robust and consistent:

### Issues Found:

1. **Inconsistent Resource Management**
   - Energy replenishment at turn start was +2 instead of the documented +5
   - No proper handling of traits that modify energy replenishment

2. **Redundant Logic**
   - Both Game.js and ActionPanel.js had duplicate code for handling turn end
   - This could lead to race conditions or inconsistent states

3. **Global Dependencies**
   - ActionPanel had fallbacks to window.game that create tight coupling
   - No proper dependency injection for turn system in some places

4. **Insufficient Error Handling**
   - Most methods didn't return success/failure indicators
   - Limited error reporting for critical failures

### Implemented Improvements:

1. **Centralized Turn Management**
   - Made Game.endTurn() the single source of truth for ending turns
   - Added comprehensive error handling
   - Returned boolean status to indicate success/failure

2. **Fixed Resource Management**
   - Updated energy replenishment to match documentation (+5 instead of +2)
   - Added proper handling for the 'energy_efficiency' trait
   - Ensured consistent resource updates with proper event emission

3. **Streamlined Dependencies**
   - Modified ActionPanel to use proper dependency chains
   - Reduced reliance on global window.game reference
   - Improved error feedback for missing dependencies

4. **Enhanced Initialization**
   - Added proper cleanup of event listeners during re-initialization
   - Implemented better error handling in initialization methods
   - Added system initialization events for better debugging

These improvements make the turn system more robust, consistent with documentation, and easier to maintain. The defensive programming approach will prevent many potential runtime errors and make the game more stable.
